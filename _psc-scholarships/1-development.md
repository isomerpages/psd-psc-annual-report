## **Moulding Tomorrow’s Leaders**

The PSC Scholarships provide a developmental pathway to leadership roles in the Public Service. Scholarship holders are involved in a series of milestone programmes and other developmental opportunities during their studies, to develop a diverse set of experiences and contribute better to Singapore.

The Preparatory Course aims to prepare newly awarded PSC scholarship holders for their studies and set the expectation on their roles as ambassadors of the Singapore Public Service. In 2020, the programme was held virtually from 19 June to 3 July.

The PSMP, held midway through a scholarship holder’s undergraduate studies, builds on the foundations laid in the Preparatory Course and the scholarship holders’ undergraduate experiences. The programme provides greater context on the realities of governance and highlights developments that have taken place since the scholarship holders commenced their studies. The PSMP also consists of a six-to-eight-week internship component with a government agency where scholarship holders gain first-hand experience in the Public Service. The 2020 PSMP was attended by 86 scholarship holders.

### **Gap Year Programme**

Scholarship holders have the option of taking up a year-long attachment in non-public sector organisations, locally or overseas. These include International Organisations, reputable Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) or private companies. The Gap Year programme takes place upon completion of studies, after completion of National Service (where applicable) and before being deployed to the Public Service. The experience from these stints help to introduce diversity into the talent pipeline and bring with them networks useful for the Public Service.

In 2020, scholarship holders proceeded for their Gap Year programmes with the following organisations: 4D Molecular Therapeutics; Big Idea Ventures; Camphora Pte. Ltd., Singapore; Elixir Pte. Ltd., Singapore; Interpol, Singapore; Lovelytics; Singtel; Social Policy, NTUC Administration and Research Unit; The Thought Collective; UNESCO (France, Thailand), UNCDF (Thailand) and YoungPlanet.
