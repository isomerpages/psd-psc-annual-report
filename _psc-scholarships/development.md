## **Moulding Tomorrow’s Leaders**

Scholarship holders are involved in a series of milestone programmes and other developmental opportunities during their studies, to develop a diverse set of experiences and contribute better to Singapore. 

### **2021 Preparatory Course**

The Preparatory Course aims to prepare newly awarded PSC scholarship holders for their studies and set the expectations on their roles as ambassadors of the Singapore Public Service. In 2021, the programme was held virtually from 21 June to 2 July. An important component of the Preparatory Course is participating in the Youth Corp Leaders Programme (YCLP), which allows scholarship holders to identify, plan and execute projects that address issues in the community and support a meaningful cause. The YCLP projects that were completed by PSC scholarship holders in 2021 include “Project Free Bard”, “Project Life Journaller” and “Team Kinderjoy” and a brief description of these projects are in the following paragraphs.

*Project Free Bard*

Project Free Bard aims to empower youth to express their emotions in a healthy manner through the literary arts and to inculcate an appreciation of and engagement with the arts. This was achieved through weekly activities ranging from team building games, to poetry-related games and exercises, to riddles, to art and craft. The team also worked with SHINE Children and Youth Services, CampusImpact and FaithActs, where 30 to 40 students in total have benefited from Project Free Bard.

*Project Life Journaller*

Project Life Journaller was a pilot project with All Saints Home (ASH) to engage elderly residents through reminiscence therapy. Through meaningful, in-depth conversations with the elderly about their life experiences, the team co-created scrapbooks that covered these experiences and allowed the elderly to feel hopeful about the future.

*Team Kinderjoy*

Team Kinderjoy was founded with Life Community Services Singapore (LCSS). This idea stemmed from wanting to provide meaningful exposure for children of incarcerated parents - to inculcate values such as independence, confidence, curiosity etc. and instil important habits like recycling and financial management through a series of interesting activities. Activities include Art and Craft, Financial Literacy and Care Languages among other interesting games to engage the children. Most of the activities were carried through day camps.

### **2021 PSC Scholarship Holders’ Mid-Course Programme (PSMP)**

The PSMP, held midway through a scholarship holder’s undergraduate studies, builds on the foundations laid in the Preparatory Course and the scholarship holders’ undergraduate experiences. The programme provides greater context on the realities of governance and highlights developments that have taken place since the scholarship holders commenced their studies. The PSMP also consists of a six-to-eight-week internship component with a government agency where scholarship holders gain first-hand experience in the Public Service. 71 scholarship holders attended the 2021 PSMP.
Singapore Seminar was held on 21 July 2021, with the theme, “Sustainable Singapore – Building Our Future Today”. Bringing together scholarship holders from various Public Agencies, the seminar saw rich insights, perspectives, and discussion on sustainability issues and how they map out to Singapore’s future. 

### **Diverse Experiences Through Academic Programmes, Internships and the Gap Year Programme**

Scholarship holders are encouraged to actively seek out diverse experiences that can complement their formal education and provide them with a wider worldview. Particularly, these experiences should be in areas of strategic interest to the Public Service.

Despite the pandemic, scholarship holders still found ways to partake in various summer and exchange programmes in 2021, both online and onsite. Some examples include an exchange programme in Austria, designed to provide students with the unique opportunity to study Central European History and the Sciences Po Summer School in Human Security, France.

Beyond academic programmes, scholarship holders also take part in internships outside of the Public Service. For example, in 2021, scholarship holders had stints with Amazon Web Services and Lazada Group. Scholarship holders also have the option of taking up a year-long attachment locally or overseas via the Gap Year programme. These include International Organisations, reputable Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) or private companies.  The experiences from these stints help to introduce diversity into the talent pipeline and bring with them networks useful for the Public Service.

In 2021, scholarship holders proceeded for their Gap Year programmes with the following organisations: ChipBrain LLC (United States of America); Corpy&Co., Inc. (Japan); Interpol, Singapore; Kouo.Ltd (United Kingdom); Singtel; UNESCO (France, Vietnam); and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (United States of America).
