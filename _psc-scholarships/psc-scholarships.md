<h2><strong>PSC Scholarships - A Gateway to Public Service Careers</strong></h2>
<p>The PSC awards full scholarships to outstanding young men and women who
are committed to serving Singapore through a career in the Public Service.
The PSC Scholarships are open to applicants at various points in their
education journey and offer three main career paths – Public Administration,
Professional Service and Uniformed Service. Successful applicants may be
awarded the scholarship prior to their undergraduate studies, during their
undergraduate studies (as a mid-term scholarship recipient) or after completing
their undergraduate studies with no more than three years of working experience
in the private or people sectors (as a Master’s scholarship recipient).
The multiple entry points have enabled the PSC to recruit scholarship holders
with diverse perspectives and backgrounds.</p>
<h3><strong>Public Administration</strong></h3>
<p>Recipients of the PSC Scholarship or PSC Master’s Scholarship will assume
a role in Public Administration. They are not tied to a specific Ministry
at the start of their scholarship journey and can be deployed across different
agencies after graduation. The Public Administration pathway provides scholarship
holders the opportunity to develop as a leader and gain experience in multiple
sectors of the Public Service.</p>
<p>PSC introduced the PSC Scholarship (Sustainability) under the Public Administration
career pathway in 2023. Recipients of the PSC Scholarship (Sustainability)
or PSC Master’s Scholarship (Sustainability) will develop domain capabilities
in sustainability and circularity and contribute to realising Singapore’s
vision of a sustainable and future-ready nation. They will be deployed
across different agencies to work on initiatives relating to the circular
and green economy, coastal protection, biodiversity, urban heat issues
and sustainable land use, to name a few.</p>

<h3><strong>Professional Service</strong></h3>
<p>Some candidates have a clear focus and interest in the career path they
wish to pursue. The Professional Service pathway develops scholarship holders
for a specific career in Engineering, Foreign Service, Judicial Service/Legal
Service, Medicine, Public Finance or Teaching Service. Recipients of these
scholarships return to serve in the respective agencies linked to their
scholarships and are guided and developed in line with their professional
tracks.</p>

<h3><strong>Uniformed Service</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC also awards the Singapore Armed Forces Scholarship (SAFS) and
the Singapore Police Force Scholarship (SPFS) to outstanding young men
and women who respond to the call of defending the nation and are committed
to maintaining peace and stability, and law and order in our country.</p>
<p>SAFS holders are systematically trained and developed to assume key command
and staff appointments in the SAF, while SPFS holders are groomed to lead
the Home Team in upholding law, maintaining order and keeping peace in
Singapore.</p>
<p>In 2023, the PSC announced the extension of the SAFS and SPFS to mid-term
applicants to further diversify the range of scholarship offerings beyond
the pre-university levels. This provides promising candidates, who may
decide on an SAF or SPF career during university, the opportunity to apply
for the mid-term scholarship from 2024 onwards.</p>

<h2><strong>Identifying Talent</strong></h2>
<p>The PSC adopts a rigorous process to select scholarship holders and considers
a range of information from multiple sources. These include the candidate’s
personal statement, school report, achievements in Co-Curricular Activities,
community involvement, academic results and other notable achievements.
The holistic assessment brings out key factors the PSC seeks in candidates,
including leadership potential, resilience, diversity of experience, aptitude,
passion and fit for a Public Service career. The PSC has adopted a range
of tools, allowing the selection panel an insight into some of the non-intellectual
and whole person traits of our applicants. The PSC continually reviews
its battery of tools for scholarship selection and enhances it to ensure
that the right talent is selected.</p>
<p>The PSC provides updated information on the PSC Scholarships and Public
Service careers to our stakeholders through regular meetings with school
leaders, as well as sessions for students and their parents.</p>
<p>In 2023, the PSC expanded its annual Scholarship Information Session to
a Whole-Of-Government Scholarship Fair involving over 40 agencies. The
scholarship fair provided a ‘one-stop’ platform for prospective scholarship
applicants and their parents to learn more about the careers and scholarships
offered by the various agencies. Key overseas education partners were also
invited to share on the tertiary education opportunities in France, Germany,
Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<p>The PSC works in close partnership with agencies, schools, universities
and self-help community groups to reach out to a diverse profile of candidates
and raise awareness of the scholarship and career options available in
the Public Service. In 2023, the PSC established the Alumni Network which
brought together over 160 volunteers from the Public Service talent programmes
to complement and support engagement and partnership efforts. Over the
past year, the Network has supported close to 20 initiatives and engaged
a diverse range of student profiles through school engagement sessions
and leadership programmes.</p>
