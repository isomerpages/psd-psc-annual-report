# **RECRUITING TALENT, DEVELOPING LEADERS**

The PSC awards full scholarships to outstanding young men and women who are committed to serving Singapore through a career in the Public Service. Applicants may apply for and be awarded the scholarship depending on their preferred career pathway. This can take place prior to their undergraduate studies, during their undergraduate studies (as a mid-term scholarship candidate) or after their undergraduate studies with no more than three years of working experience in the private or people sector (as a PSC Master’s Scholarship candidate). The multiple entry points have enabled the PSC to have scholarship holders that possess diverse perspectives and mindsets. PSC scholarship holders study various disciplines at established local and overseas universities and take on different opportunities during their periods of study, adding to the diversity of the Public Service when they commence their careers.


## **Identifying Talent** 

The PSC adopts a rigorous process to select scholarship holders. The Commission considers a range of information from multiple sources. These include the candidate’s personal statement, school report, Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) achievements, community involvement records, academic results and other notable achievements. The holistic assessment brings out key factors the PSC seeks in candidates, including leadership potential, resilience, diversity of experience, aptitude and passion and fit for a Public Service career. The PSC has adopted  a range of assessment tools, which identify behavioural traits in applicants such as risk propensity and learning orientation, allowing the selection panel an insight into some of the non-intellectual traits of scholarship applicants.

The PSC has continued to provide updated information on PSC Scholarships and Public Service careers to our stakeholders through regular meetings with school leaders, as well as information sessions for students and their parents. In 2021, the PSC held virtual information sessions for pre-university and university students in view of prevailing safe management measures.

To build a diverse leadership corps for the Public Service, the PSC has strengthened efforts in attracting diverse applicants for the PSC Scholarships. These efforts include partnerships with universities to increase the number of mature applicants (those who apply as a mid-term candidate or for the PSC Master’s Scholarship) and the engagement of self-help community groups like SINDA and MENDAKI to raise awareness of the PSC Scholarships.


## **PSC Scholarships - A Gateway to Public Service Careers** 
The PSC Scholarships offer three main career paths – Public Administration, Professional Service and Uniformed Service.

### **Public Administration**

Recipients of the PSC Scholarship or PSC Master’s Scholarship will take up a role in Public Administration. These recipients are not tied to a specific Ministry at the start of their scholarship journey and their deployment is decided upon their graduation. The Public Administration pathway provides scholarship holders the opportunity to develop as a leader and gain experience in multiple sectors of the Public Service.

### **Professional Service**

Some candidates have a clear focus and interest in the career path they wish to pursue. For them, the PSC offers career tracks such as Engineering, Foreign Service, Legal Service, Medicine, Public Finance, or Teaching Service under the Professional Service career pathway. Recipients of these scholarships will return to serve in the respective agencies linked to their scholarships and are guided and developed in line with their professional tracks.

### **Uniformed Service**

Recipients who respond to the call of security and defence of the nation will set off on the pathway of the Uniformed Services. The PSC awards The Singapore Armed Forces Scholarship (SAFS) and The Singapore Police Force Scholarship (SPFS) to outstanding young men and women who make the commitment to maintain peace and stability, and law and order in our country. 

SAFS holders will be systematically trained and developed to assume key command and staff appointments in the SAF while SPFS holders will be groomed to be leaders in upholding law, maintaining order and keeping peace in Singapore.

### **President’s Scholarship** 

The PSC also awards the President’s Scholarship – widely regarded as Singapore’s most prestigious undergraduate scholarship. The President’s Scholarship is awarded on top of a public sector scholarship. It recognises individuals who have stood out among their cohort, demonstrating excellence in various pursuits. Recipients of the President’s Scholarship are dedicated to improving the lives of Singaporeans and exemplify the ethos of the Public Service. 

In 2021, there were two recipients of the President’s Scholarship (Table 5).
