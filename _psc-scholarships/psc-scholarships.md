<h2><strong>PSC Scholarships - A Gateway to Public Service Careers</strong></h2>
<p>The PSC awards full scholarships to outstanding young men and women who
are committed to serving Singapore through a career in the Public Service.
The PSC Scholarships are open to applicants at various points in their
education journey and offer three main career paths – Public Administration,
Professional Service and Uniformed Service. Successful applicants may be
awarded the scholarship prior to their undergraduate studies, during their
undergraduate studies (as a mid-term scholarship recipient) or after completing
their undergraduate studies with no more than three years of working experience
in the private or people sectors (as a Master’s scholarship recipient).
The multiple entry points have enabled the PSC to recruit scholarship holders
with diverse perspectives and backgrounds.</p>
<h3><strong>Public Administration</strong></h3>
<p>Recipients of the PSC Scholarship or PSC Master’s Scholarship will assume
a role in Public Administration. They are not tied to a specific Ministry
at the start of their scholarship journey and can be deployed across different
agencies after graduation. The Public Administration pathway provides scholarship
holders the opportunity to develop as a leader and gain experience in multiple
sectors of the Public Service.</p>
<p>PSC introduced the PSC Scholarship (Sustainability) under the Public Administration
career pathway in 2023. Recipients of the PSC Scholarship (Sustainability)
or PSC Master’s Scholarship (Sustainability) will develop domain capabilities
in sustainability and circularity and contribute to realising Singapore’s
vision of a sustainable and future-ready nation. They will be deployed
across different agencies to work on initiatives relating to the circular
and green economy, coastal protection, biodiversity, urban heat issues
and sustainable land use, to name a few.</p>

<h3><strong>Professional Service</strong></h3>
<p>Some candidates have a clear focus and interest in the career path they
wish to pursue. The Professional Service pathway develops scholarship holders
for a specific career in Engineering, Foreign Service, Judicial Service/Legal
Service, Medicine, Public Finance or Teaching Service. Recipients of these
scholarships return to serve in the respective agencies linked to their
scholarships and are guided and developed in line with their professional
tracks.</p>

<h3><strong>Uniformed Service</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC also awards the Singapore Armed Forces Scholarship (SAFS) and
the Singapore Police Force Scholarship (SPFS) to outstanding young men
and women who respond to the call of defending the nation and are committed
to maintaining peace and stability, and law and order in our country.</p>
<p>SAFS holders are systematically trained and developed to assume key command
and staff appointments in the SAF, while SPFS holders are groomed to lead
the Home Team in upholding law, maintaining order and keeping peace in
Singapore.</p>
<p>In 2023, the PSC announced the extension of the SAFS and SPFS to mid-term
applicants to further diversify the range of scholarship offerings beyond
the pre-university levels. This provides promising candidates, who may
decide on an SAF or SPF career during university, the opportunity to apply
for the mid-term scholarship from 2024 onwards.</p>

<h2><strong>Identifying Talent</strong></h2>
<p>The PSC adopts a rigorous process to select scholarship holders. The Commission
considers a range of information from multiple sources. These include the
candidate’s personal statement, school report, Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
achievements, community involvement records, academic results and other
notable achievements. The holistic assessment brings out key factors the
PSC seeks in candidates, including leadership potential, resilience, diversity
of experience, aptitude, and passion and fit for a Public Service career.
The PSC has adopted a range of assessment tools, allowing the selection
panel an insight into some of the non-intellectual, whole person traits
of scholarship applicants. The PSC continually reviews its battery of assessment
tools for scholarship selection and seeks improvements to it to ensure
that the right talent is selected holistically.</p>
<p>The PSC provides updated information on the PSC Scholarships and Public
Service careers to our stakeholders through regular meetings with school
leaders, as well as information sessions for students and their parents.
The PSC also values and works in close partnerships with schools, universities
and self-help community groups to raise awareness of the PSC Scholarships
across a diverse profile of candidates.</p>
<h2><strong>2022 PSC Scholarship Recipients</strong></h2>
<p>In 2022, the PSC took steps to cautiously resume in-person activities,
holding its first physical PSC Scholarships Award Ceremony since 2019.
The event, held on 20 July 2022, was graced by Mr Chan Chun Sing, Minister
for Education and Minister-in-Charge of the Public Service.</p>

<h3><strong>President’s Scholarship</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC also awards the President’s Scholarship – widely regarded as Singapore’s
most prestigious undergraduate scholarship. The President’s Scholarship
is awarded on top of a public sector scholarship. It recognises individuals
who have stood out among their cohort, demonstrating excellence in various
pursuits. Recipients of the President’s Scholarship are dedicated to improving
the lives of Singaporeans and exemplify the ethos of the Public Service.</p>
