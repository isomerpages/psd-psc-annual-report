<h1><strong>THE PSC’S ROLE</strong></h1>
<p>The Public Service Commission (PSC) is constituted under Part IX of the
Constitution of the Republic of Singapore.</p>
<p>The functions of the PSC under the Constitution are as follows:</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appoint,</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirm,</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emplace on the permanent or pensionable establishment,</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Promote,</p>
<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer, and</p>
<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dismiss and exercise disciplinary control over public
officers*.</p>
<p>*<em>These categories of officers do not fall under the PSC’s purview: Singapore Armed Forces personnel, officers in the Judicial and Legal Services, and Police Officers below the rank of Inspector.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Under the Public Sector (Governance) Act 2018 which came into effect on
1 April 2018, the PSC’s concurrence is required for the appointment, promotion
and discipline of Chief Executive Officers of Statutory Boards.</p>
<p>Since 1995, the following personnel functions have been devolved to the
Personnel Boards in the Ministries:</p>
<p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recruitment and appointment to the Civil Service
except the Administrative Service and Auditing Service,</p>
<p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirmation and emplacement of officers on the permanent
or pensionable establishment,</p>
<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appointment and promotion of officers up to Superscale
E1/Grade 8 (except for the Auditing Service), and</p>
<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer of service among services other than transfers
to the Administrative Service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The PSC is the final appellate body to consider appeals against decisions
of the Special Personnel Board.</p>
<p>The PSC performs a non-constitutional role of recruiting and developing
talent for the Singapore Public Service through PSC Scholarships, as well
as coordinating the efforts of scholarship-awarding agencies.<strong><br></strong>
