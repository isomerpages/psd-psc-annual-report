### **Discipline**

The PSC is vested with the disciplinary control of civil servants under Article 110(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Civil servants who misconduct themselves are dealt with under one of the three disciplinary procedures^ listed below: 

**a)	The Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations (“the Regulations”).**

**b)	The Public Service Commission (Delegation of Disciplinary Functions) Directions (“the Directions”).**

*The PSC has delegated to the Permanent Secretaries, part of its functions pertaining to the discipline of officers for minor misconduct,* and

**c)	The Public Service Commission (Prison Officers) (Disciplinary Proceedings – Delegation of Functions) Directions (“the Prisons Directions”).** 

*The PSC has delegated to the Commissioner of Prisons, part of its functions pertaining to the discipline of junior Prisons Officers for minor misconduct.*

*^Officers may be disciplined under the Regulations when it involves serious misconducts; where the possible penalties include a dismissal or a reduction in rank. For less serious misconducts, officers may be disciplined under the Directions or Prison Directions, as appropriate.*

Cases under the latter two categories are collectively known as being under “the Directions”.

In 2021, 172 new disciplinary cases were reported to the PSC. Together with 128 cases that were brought forward from 2020, the PSC processed a total of 300 cases in the year. Of these cases, 141 were completed, including 49 cases which were completed under the Regulations and 70 cases which were completed under the Directions. Formal disciplinary action was not instituted against the officers in the remaining 22 cases.

The most common types of misconduct for cases completed in 2021 under the Regulations were Non-Compliance of Orders, Dishonesty and Sexual Offences. Slightly more than half of all officers disciplined under the Regulations were dismissed or retired in the public interest at the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings against them. Details of the 49 cases completed under the Regulations in 2021 are in Table 1.
