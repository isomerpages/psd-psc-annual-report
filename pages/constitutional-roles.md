The PSC also appoints/promotes officers to Superscale Grade 9 and above in the Auditing Service, and to Superscale D/Grade 7 and above in the rest of the Civil Service.

### **Appointment and Promotion of Chief Executive Officers of Statutory Boards**

The PSC considers the suitability of candidates for appointment as Chief Executive Officers of Statutory Boards and subsequent renewals. The PSC also considers the suitability of the Chief Executive Officers for promotion to Superscale D/Grade 7 and above.

### **Appeals**

In 2020, the PSC saw two further appeals for promotion/against termination under the Public Service (Personnel Boards and Appeals Board) Regulations. The appeals were turned down by the Commission. 

### **Discipline**

The PSC is vested with the disciplinary control of civil servants under Article 110(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Civil servants who misconduct themselves are dealt with under one of the three disciplinary procedures+ listed below: 

**a)	The Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations (“the Regulations”).**

**b)	The Public Service Commission (Delegation of Disciplinary Functions) Directions (“the Directions”).**

*The PSC has delegated to the Permanent Secretaries, part of its functions pertaining to the discipline of officers for minor misconduct,* and

**c)	The Public Service Commission (Prison Officers) (Disciplinary Proceedings – Delegation of Functions) Directions (“the Prisons Directions”).** 

*The PSC has delegated to the Commissioner of Prisons, part of its functions pertaining to the discipline of junior Prisons Officers for minor misconduct.*

*+Officers may be disciplined under the Regulations when it involves serious misconducts; where the possible penalties include a dismissal or a reduction in rank. For less serious misconducts, officers may be disciplined under the Directions or Prison Directions, as appropriate.*

Cases under the latter two categories are collectively known as being under “the Directions”. The disciplinary process ensures that officers are treated fairly, regardless of rank or seniority.

In 2020, 145 new disciplinary cases were reported to the PSC. Together with 110 cases that were brought forward from 2019, the PSC processed a total of 255 cases in the year. Of these cases, 127 were completed, including 51 cases which were completed under the Regulations and 61 cases which were completed under the Directions. Formal disciplinary action was not instituted against the officers in the remaining 15 cases. 

The most common types of misconduct for cases completed in 2020 under the Regulations were Sexual Offences / Inappropriate Behaviour, Dishonesty / Embezzlement / Criminal Breach of Trust, Indebtedness, and Negligence. Almost two-thirds of all officers disciplined under the Regulations were dismissed or retired in the public interest at the conclusion of the disciplinary proceedings against them. Details of the 51 cases completed under the Regulations in 2020 are in Table 1.
