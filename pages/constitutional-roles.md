<h1><strong>APPOINTMENTS, PROMOTIONS, APPEALS AND DISCIPLINARY CASES</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>Appointments and Promotions</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC is the approving authority for the appointment of candidates to
the Administrative Service and the promotion of these officers to Grade
7 and above. The PSC also appoints and promotes officers to Superscale
Grade 9 and above in the Auditing Service, and to Superscale D/Grade 7
and above in the rest of the Civil Service.</p>
<p>In 2023, the PSC considered 23 candidates and found 21 suitable for appointment
to the Administrative Service.</p>
<p>The PSC approved 38 officers for promotion to Superscale D/Grade 7 and
above, including those in the Administrative Service.</p>
<p>There were no appointments nor promotions into and within Superscale grades
in the Auditing Service.</p>
<h3><strong>Appointments and Promotions of Chief Executive Officers of Statutory Boards</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC considers the suitability of candidates for appointment as Chief
Executive Officers of Statutory Boards and subsequent renewals. The PSC
also considers the suitability of the Chief Executive Officers for promotion
to Superscale D/Grade 7 and above.</p>
<p>In 2023, the PSC considered and concurred with the agencies’ recommendation

<h3><strong>Appeals</strong></h3>
<p>In 2023, the PSC considered one further appeal against termination under
the Public Service (Personnel Boards and Appeals Board) Regulations.</p>
<h3><strong>Discipline</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC is vested with the disciplinary control of civil servants under
Article 110(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Civil
servants who misconduct themselves are dealt with under one of the three
disciplinary procedures^ listed below:</p>
<p><strong>a) The Public Service (Disciplinary Proceedings) Regulations 2023 (“the Regulations”);</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>b) The Public Service Commission (Delegation of Disciplinary Functions) Directions (“the Directions”);</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>c) The Public Service Commission (Prison Officers) (Disciplinary Proceedings – Delegation of Functions) Directions (“the Prisons Directions”).</strong>
</p>
<p>Cases under the latter two categories are collectively known as being
under “the Directions”.</p>
<p><em>^Officers may be disciplined under the Regulations when it involves serious misconduct, where the possible penalties include a dismissal or a demotion. For less serious misconduct, officers may be disciplined under the Directions or Prison Directions, as appropriate. The PSC has delegated to the Permanent Secretaries / Commissioner of Prisons part of its functions pertaining to the discipline of officers for minor misconduct.</em>
</p>
<p>The revised disciplinary legislation was implemented in 2023. A total
of 136 new disciplinary cases were reported to the PSC in 2023. Together
with 95 cases that were brought forward from previous years, the PSC processed
a total of 231 cases in the year. 149 cases (65%) were completed. Of these
completed cases, 60 cases were completed under the Regulations, 71 cases
were completed under the Directions, and no formal disciplinary action
was instituted against the officers in the remaining 18 cases.</p>
<p>The most common types of misconduct cases completed under the Regulations
were Drug Offences and Non-Compliance of Orders. <u>Table 1</u> shows the
breakdown of the 60 cases completed under the Regulations.</p>
