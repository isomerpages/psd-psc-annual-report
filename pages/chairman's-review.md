### **COVID-19 DEFINED 2020**
During the early days of the pandemic, the public mood in Singapore was volatile, beginning with uncertainty as to the extent of viral transmission, bouts of panic buying of essential goods, and a mix of adjustments to daily routines, leading to the imposition of clearer measures for “circuit breaker”. These measures, which involved the sharp curtailing of entertainment, shopping and movement plans, had differing degrees of impact on daily life; on how families went about their education, work and business. The most severe impact was felt by the vulnerable and disadvantaged groups and by those whose work required physical presence at a given location. Front line workers, often taken for granted, became better appreciated for their roles serving Singaporeans. 

Singapore saw our supply chains disrupted by border closures and lockdowns. Having long thrived on trade and in being connected to the global economy, we faced the sharpest threat to our value to others in enabling travel, movement of goods and providing services. Markets for our manufacturing activities were impacted. Our economy contracted and we went into our worst recession since independence. Geopolitical tensions in the world were heightened by the pandemic as a result of domestic as well as border issues, with ugly suspicions and attribution of blame. Tensions between the desire for personal freedoms and the need for collective action to safeguard public health arose in many countries. Fault lines and underlying socio-economic inequalities in all societies were accentuated.

Our Public Service played a key role in meeting these challenges in Singapore. Resources were mobilised across the public, private and people sectors. Proactive public communications, on both traditional and social media platforms, were key in addressing anxieties, countering rumours and misinformation and in building trust and psychological resilience. Numerous complex issues and challenges emerged over the course of the pandemic, from border and quarantine policy, securing supply chains for food and essential goods, controlling the outbreaks in the foreign worker dormitories, to ensuring that Singapore would have sufficient supply of vaccines when available. Where mistakes and oversights happened, they were acknowledged, and efforts made to address them. Each risk was managed as it was identified. Public sector competence and professionalism was crucial in helping to maintain social cohesion and confidence in Singapore amid a prolonged crisis. 

### **STRENGTHENING SINGAPORE**
This past year brought home that Singapore does not have a pre-ordained place in the world. We must re-examine our strengths and weaknesses, understand better our relationships with others, and chart our course. Even as many nations turn inwards, the Public Service must address the reality that Singapore’s relevance to the rest of the world determines our future. With open borders and external markets remaining critical to our long-term interests and the world entering a second year of the pandemic, Singapore must maintain connectivity to the region and the world, whilst working for greater resilience and robustness in critical areas. 

COVID-19 accelerated digital transformation as nations and businesses scrambled for digital solutions to cope with remote working, formal education and business operations. What had been seen as good to have has now become a critical requirement – the pandemic has made clear that we can and should move faster. In addition, the drive to increase our resilience and robustness to shocks has given new impetus and direction to our innovation, on top of the value we must create for our external logistics and markets.

Now that the world is more uncertain, it is clearer than ever that we need a Public Service that can help Singapore pull through this crisis, and one that partners the people and private sectors to maintain social cohesion and navigate new directions. 

### **PUBLIC SERVICE PRIORITIES**
Emerging stronger will not come from repeating what we did previously. In the emerging environment, new waves of innovation, entrepreneurship and risk will surface. Public officers will have to be bold and curious, because we will increasingly have to enable, facilitate and regulate at the leading edge. Public officers will have to grow knowledge and new skills, acting swiftly to address where we are lacking, and develop confidence in new domains.

It is not possible for the public sector to achieve this on our own, so building trust and collaboration with both the people and private sectors is needed. The people sector provides insights and channels for the Service to reach various segments of society to address their needs and concerns, which is key to social cohesion. The private sector is an engine of growth and where we build our skills and capacity to grow value and jobs.

Increasingly, our Public Service will need to engage in the international arena, to maintain and build anew the relationships that will serve Singapore well. The Singapore brand must be strengthened, not only for inward investment, but also for our external investments and our ability to influence areas that are key to our interests, whether in business, multilateral discussions or bilateral relations.

### **WHAT THE PSC WILL DO**
In a complex and increasingly educated Singapore, the Public Service leadership will benefit from diversity of backgrounds, experience, skills and thinking. The Commission will continue to purposefully reach out to a broader group from diverse backgrounds and attract talent at different stages of life. We will continue to provide young scholarship holders with opportunities to learn and build connections, develop skills and gain enriching experience, and take advantage of local and international opportunities for professional growth and leadership development. In the appointment of leaders, the Commission will recognise and give due weight to both policy development and operational execution.

The pandemic has revitalised the values that are the foundation of our Public Service. Integrity – manifested in the data-driven and science-based approach taken to understand the nature of the pandemic and what is needed to safeguard the health and safety of people. Service – by putting citizens at the centre of various care and support initiatives and the implementation of measures. Excellence – in addressing the myriad challenges and in our relentless drive for better outcomes as the situation evolves and new issues emerge.

Key to emerging stronger together is strengthening our social support system to ensure no one is left behind. How Singaporeans co-create solutions to seize opportunities and make Singapore a better place will aid inclusive growth. The pace of transformation will pick up from providing the private sector the support and room to try out new approaches and models.

We continue to look for those with a heart to serve Singapore and our community, people who demonstrate the values of the Public Service, regardless of race, religion or family background, who can earn public trust, and who can build relationships for successful collaboration. The scope of our outreach will continue to widen to search for suitable candidates, and in parallel, our selection will go beyond intellectual capacity to identify, in a robust and quantifiable manner, those aspects of character and personality that make a Public Service Leader.
