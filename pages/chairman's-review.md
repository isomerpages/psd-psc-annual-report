After close to three years of battling COVID-19, we have emerged from the pandemic stronger and more united as a nation. The Public Service was critical in supporting this fight. There are many lessons from this effort which will help build an even stronger Public Service, not only through internal collaborations but through partnerships with the private and people sectors. This will require the highest standards not just of intellect, but the ability to operationalise policies and build relationships and trust.

### **RESUMPTION OF KEY ACTIVITIES**
A wide-scale return of in-person activities marked Singapore’s recovery from COVID-19. When business and economic activities were able to resume, the Public Service Commission was also able to conduct its business face-to-face. We were delighted that we could once again organise a full range of activities.

For those embarking on their studies on PSC Scholarships, these key events and activities have both practical use for personal and team development as well as meaning for shaping of values. Our milestone programmes, ceremonies and engagements are part of the rites of passage for those entering public service through this route.

In doing so, we provide scholarship holders with the opportunity for cohort-bonding and community involvement, as well as allow parents, teachers, and partner organisations to celebrate and reinforce the commencement of the journey of those they have helped. We learnt during the pandemic to re-imagine different ways to mark this, and we will continue to strengthen our approach.

### **GREATER DIVERSITY OF TALENT NEEDED FOR FUTURE CHALLENGES**
The PSC scholarship programme is a sustained effort over many years to grow a pool of outstanding and dedicated talent to serve the nation. We periodically review our approach in selection and scholarship offerings to ensure these meet emerging challenges and talent needs.

In 2022, we sought to welcome more candidates at different points of their education journey. We established new partnerships with local autonomous universities to identify and engage outstanding students for the PSC Mid-Term and Master’s scholarships. These resulted in a modest rise in the number of these scholarship awards. We will need to bring in more diverse talent, to bring fresh perspectives and different life experiences into the Public Service.

2022 also saw the announcement of the PSC Sustainability Scholarships. The PSC Scholarship (Sustainability) and PSC Master’s Scholarship (Sustainability) seek to build and strengthen our capability in Sustainability and Circularity, and attract those interested to serve in these domains in the Public Service. The new scholarships are being offered from the 2023 selection cycle. Recipients may study a range of different disciplines and can look forward to roles in various public sector ministries and agencies, dealing with climate change, sustainability, and green government.

We were also able, in the past year, to resume engagements at the international level. Commission Members made two trips – one trip to France, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and another to the United States of America - to understand the latest developments in their higher education systems and identify opportunities for our students to tap into, as well as to promote PSC Scholarships and a Public Service career to Singaporean students overseas. In our bid for diversity, these are efforts we will scale up to reach more overseas Singaporean students who are interested in a career in the Public Service.

As travel restrictions eased, our scholarship holders have largely resumed overseas exchanges, programmes and internships. We continue to encourage and support international exchange to enable talent in the Public Service to develop varied life experiences, insights and networks.

### **UPHOLDING DISCIPLINE**
The Public Service Commission is vested with the disciplinary control of civil servants under Article 110(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and three sets of disciplinary legislation. In 2022, we concluded a significant review of this body of longstanding laws as well as the processing of cases. As part of the legislative review, rules and policies were updated to align with progressive employment practices. We streamlined internal processes and practices whilst ensuring that the rigour of the disciplinary process was maintained.

Some of these efforts have borne fruit and helped to complete disciplinary cases in a timelier manner. Specifically, I am pleased to report that the Commission concluded over 100 discipline cases in 2022 compared to an average of around 40 cases each year between 2019 and 2021. Closing discipline cases more expeditiously ensures that misconduct is dealt with swiftly and decisively, and for those cleared of misconduct, a quicker exoneration and return to productive work for them, their families, and their workplace. These updates and improvements assist the Commission to continue to exercise our duties, without fear or favour, to uphold the highest levels of discipline in the Public Service.

### **MOVING FORWARD**
We expect Singapore will face a more volatile and uncertain environment in future. To overcome challenges and seize opportunities that may come our way, we must continue to build and develop a resilient Public Service united in its mission to serve Singapore, that is diverse in experience, capabilities and skills, to be able to do its job well. The Public Service Commission looks to help build a strong leadership pipeline and support an exceptional Public Service culture worthy of Singaporeans.
