<p>Singapore fully transitioned to living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease
in 2023. Our society held together and emerged united from the pandemic.
As shared by Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong in Parliament during the
Debate on the Motion on Singapore’s Response to COVID-19, the most important
lesson learnt from the crisis is that<em> </em><strong><em>we are stronger when we stand and work together</em>.</strong> This
key takeaway will continue to guide our future approaches. Across the Public
Service, agencies need to continue working together with the private and
people sector, in the interest of the common good, to enable Singapore
to overcome our challenges.</p>
<p>Today, Singapore faces an international environment fraught with tensions
and uncertainties. Being small and open, as a country trading with the
rest of the world, Singapore is susceptible to the fraying of the global
economic order and disruption of supply chains when countries turn to protectionist
measures. These challenges have reinforced the need for Singapore to cultivate
a diverse leadership pipeline, to lead the next generation in adapting
to the shifting global dynamics, building bridges across different communities,
and identifying new approaches to issues that confront us from trade diversification,
social mobility to sustainability and matters of national security. To
achieve this, we must continue to attract, develop, and retain good people
for the Public Service.</p>
<h3><strong>Building a Diverse Leadership Pipeline for an Evolving Future</strong></h3>
<p>The Public Service Commission (PSC) Scholarship reflects our commitment
to nurturing exceptional and dedicated individuals to contribute to nation-building.
We seek to enhance diversity in our leadership pipeline and refine our
selection strategies in tandem with the evolving challenges and talent
requirements. We are pleased to report progress in our efforts in 2023.</p>
<p>The 65 scholarship holders who proceeded for their studies in 2023 came
from a wide range of 19 different pre-university institutions, comprising
the Integrated Programme schools, junior colleges, polytechnics and an
international institution supporting home-based education.</p>
<p>The PSC (Sustainability) scholarship was awarded to the inaugural batch
of three individuals in 2023. They are currently pursuing their undergraduate
and postgraduate studies and will embark on a career in sustainability
and economic circularity in the Public Service upon graduation. We look
forward to seeing more students take up this scholarship in the coming
years.</p>
<p>We awarded seven mid-term PSC scholarships in public administration, public
finance, sustainability and engineering in 2023. The Public Service will
benefit from the maturity, perspectives and experience of these individuals.
As the PSC expands its range of scholarship offerings to attract talent
beyond the pre-university levels, a mid-term option will be introduced
for the Singapore Armed Forces Scholarship and the Singapore Police Force
Scholarship in 2024. These mid-term scholarships are open to undergraduate
students who have a passion to serve in the uniformed services and safeguard
our national security.</p>
<p>The scholarship experience is becoming more diverse and enriching. We
are committed to strengthening our partnerships to provide opportunities
for our scholarship holders to participate in overseas internship programmes
with international organisations and the private sector through the Gap
Year programme. This exposure to different cultures and environments enables
scholarship holders to gain an understanding of issues beyond the Public
Service, and an international network that will contribute to Singapore's
future collaborative endeavours with other countries.</p>
<p>Digital and technological literacy will become as essential as language
proficiency in shaping thoughts and ideas. I am heartened to see that many
PSC undergraduate scholarship holders have diversified into different fields
at the postgraduate level e.g. humanities majors at the undergraduate level
taking up data science and technology for their Masters, or engineers broadening
into economics and management for their Masters. Such well-rounded educational
training is helpful to prepare them to be more versatile and adaptive public
officers, who can tackle evolving and multi-disciplinary challenges.</p>
<h3><strong>Building Partnerships to Strengthen Collaboration</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC strengthened collaboration with a wide range of agencies to attract
talent to the Public Service. In 2023, we held a Whole-of-Government Scholarship
Fair to synergise the outreach efforts of different public sector scholarship-awarding
agencies. The recent establishment of a strong Alumni Network has brought
together over 160 PSC scholarship holders and public officers from the
Administrative Service and the Public Service Leadership Programme, to
serve as ambassadors for the Public Service scholarship and career. This
proactive outreach not only serves to inspire the next generation of youths
but also embodies the spirit of giving back.</p>
<p>The Public Service must also forge close partnerships with the private
and people sectors to co-create a roadmap for the next bound of nation-building
and refresh our social compact. As future leaders, it is therefore critical
that our scholarship holders take an active interest in the community.
All PSC Scholarship recipients go through the Youth Corps Leaders Programme
(YCLP) to identify, plan and execute projects that address issues in the
community and support a meaningful cause. I am pleased to report that they
completed eight YCLP projects in 2023 supporting a wide range of issues
and stakeholders from mental wellness, vulnerable youths to the elderly.</p>
<h3><strong>The Road Ahead</strong></h3>
<p>The PSC will continue to work hard to build a robust and resilient leadership
pipeline for the Public Service. Our search for talent leads us to individuals
dedicated to serving Singapore and our community and who possess the right
values. Integrity is at the heart of the Public Service’s values and is
essential for building strong institutions and for maintaining public confidence
and trust. The PSC remains steadfast in ensuring the integrity of the Public
Service by exercising disciplinary control over civil servants impartially,
regardless of their rank or seniority, and without fear or favour.</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to express my deep gratitude to
my fellow PSC members for their invaluable counsel and to the secretariat
team for their strong support. We have overcome challenging times in the
past year, and I am confident that our core values and adaptability will
position us well to navigate the road ahead.</p>
