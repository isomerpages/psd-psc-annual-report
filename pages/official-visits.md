The PSC values engagement with our partners and stakeholders to keep abreast of governance matters both locally and overseas. Besides hosting visits from representatives of foreign universities and institutions, local school leaders, thought leaders in different fields and other distinguished guests, the PSC also ventures out to engage stakeholders in other countries.

In 2022, the PSC made two overseas visits to Europe (from 3 to 10 October) and the United States (from 13 to 20 November), to build and strengthen our ties with the various educational institutions, and keep ourselves updated on new developments in the higher education landscape of these regions.

Many Ministries and agencies host and brief the PSC every year to help the Commission better understand the work and challenges of the Public Service. While some of these visits had to be done virtually in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic, in 2022, all physical on-site visits were resumed. This allowed the PSC the opportunity to interact with a wider group of officers on the ground. At these updates, the PSC learned of the varied scope of work across sectors, from emergency response operations at the SCDF to IT research and development work at GovTech.

Regardless of the sector, it was evident that public officers have put in tremendous hard work, responding as diligently and purposefully as possible to manage the pandemic while simultaneously working on new processes, initiatives, systems, and policies to bring Singapore forward. The PSC would like to give our heartfelt thanks to all officers for their hard work and resilience these past few years â€“ efforts that continue to care for our nation and bring it to the future.
