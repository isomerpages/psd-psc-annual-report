## 2019 OFFICIAL VISITS & MEETINGS

The PSC values ongoing engagement with our partners and stakeholders. Through such meaningful engagement, the PSC is able to keep abreast of governance matters both locally and overseas. Besides hosting visits by representatives of foreign universities, local school leaders, thought leaders in different fields and other distinguished guests, the PSC also ventures out to engage stakeholders in other countries.

The PSC visited universities in China, from 12 to 17 May 2019, and the United States, from 11 to 17 November 2019, to maintain its pulse on developments in the higher education landscape of these countries. The PSC also engaged PSC and public sector scholarship holders during the trips.

Discussion with university representatives centred on each university's unique approach to current challenges, admission and academic requirements. Apart from getting a feel for student life on the different campuses, the PSC also visited industry players in China to experience the Chinese business environment.

On 27 November 2019, a delegation from the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture visited the PSC to learn more about talent management in the Singapore Public Service. The meeting exchanged views on this as well as conduct and discipline matters.
