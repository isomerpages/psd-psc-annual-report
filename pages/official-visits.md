# **2021 OFFICIAL MEETINGS**

The PSC values ongoing engagement with our partners and stakeholders. Through such meaningful engagement, the PSC keeps abreast of governance matters both locally and overseas. Besides hosting visits by representatives of foreign universities, local school leaders, thought leaders in different fields and other distinguished guests, the PSC also ventures out to engage stakeholders in other countries.

In 2021, the PSC resumed official on-site visits to several ministries and agencies to better understand their work amidst the pandemic as well as their strategies for the future. Through these visits, the PSC was also able to interact with public officers who were at the forefront of the relentless fight against the pandemic. The organisations that PSC visited in 2021 cut across the different sectors of government and included Eunoia Junior College (Ministry of Education), Changi Naval Base (Ministry of Defence), Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (Ministry of Transport), Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and the Ministry of Communications and Information.

Such visits strengthen the PSC’s understanding of the Public Service, and the vision that it strives towards for Singapore’s future. This understanding helps to provide insight into the PSC’s own work as it continues building on the strengths, and addressing the gaps, of the Public Service.
