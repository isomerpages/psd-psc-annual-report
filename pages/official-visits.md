# **2020 OFFICIAL VISITS & MEETINGS**

The PSC values ongoing engagement with our partners and stakeholders. Through such meaningful engagement, the PSC keeps abreast of governance matters both locally and overseas. Besides hosting visits by representatives of foreign universities, local school leaders, thought leaders in different fields and other distinguished guests, the PSC also ventures out to engage stakeholders in other countries.

On 2 November 2020, Chairman, PSC met with the Ambassador of France to the Republic of Singapore, Mr Marc Abensour. The meeting exchanged views on the education landscape in France, Singapore-France relations and possible opportunities for work or education in France.
